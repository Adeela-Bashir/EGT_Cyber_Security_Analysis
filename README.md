# EGT_Cyber_Security_Analysis
Code for an evolutionary game-theoretic analysis of cyber security in infinite population. It contains mathematica code to plot stable equilibrium point (Stability_Figure), and Matlab code to simulate 100,000 randomly generated games (Random_games). Also, it contains python codes for simulation data plots (Simulation_Results_Plots), and empirical data plots (Empirical_Data_Plots).
